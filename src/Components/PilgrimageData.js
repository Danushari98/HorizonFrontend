  { id: 19, name: "St. Francis Church", img: StFrancisChurchImg, price: "₹3,999", days: "1 Day", location: "Kerala", description: "Historic church known for its old architecture and significance.The St. Francis Church in Fort Kochi, Kerala, holds immense historical significance as the oldest European church in India, a profound testament to the early colonial history of the subcontinent. Originally built in 1503 by Portuguese Franciscan friars, the wooden structure was later rebuilt in stone and brick in the mid-16th century, primarily serving the European Christian community. Its most monumental claim to fame is its brief role as the burial place of the legendary Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who died in Kochi in 1524 during his third voyage to India. His body rested in the church for fourteen years before being exhumed and transported to Lisbon, Portugal, but the precise spot of his original grave remains clearly marked within the church floor, a powerful draw for historians and tourists alike. Over the centuries, control of the church shifted hands from the Portuguese to the Dutch (who made it a Protestant structure in 1663), and subsequently to the British (who converted it to an Anglican church in 1795). This shift in ownership resulted in a simple, stately architectural style that contrasts sharply with the ornate, elaborate designs of later Indian churches. The architecture, therefore, is distinctively simple and sober, characteristic of the early European settlement period, featuring a plain façade, terracotta tiles, and massive wooden trusses. The interior retains historic elements, including the impressive wooden pulpit and the unique old Dutch baptism register and marriage registers. Today, the St. Francis Church is managed by the Church of South India (CSI) and stands as a protected heritage monument, providing a quiet, spiritual anchor and an irreplaceable window into the complex, layered history of the first European foothold in India." },
